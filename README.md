# PID-Proportional-Integral-Derivative-Controller
In this course project , we focus carrying out a precise movement( both linear as well as angular) control of a bot which would act
as a foundation for a bigger objective, which will be discussed in the next section of the description. 
Using DTMF(Dual tone multi-frequency) signals as control signals accounts for the distinctiveness of the project. 
It allows the user to control the bot wirelessly with no limitation on range.
In this project, we need two mobile phones. The “mobile controlled robot” is controlled by a mobile phone that makes a call to the another mobile phone attached to the robot. 
In the course of a call, if any button is pressed, a tone corresponding to the button pressed is heard at the other end of the call. 
This tone is called “Dual Tone Multiple-Frequency” (DTMF) tone.
The robot perceives this DTMF tone with the help of the phone stacked on the robot. 
The received tone is processed by the microcontroller with the help of a decoder IC. 
The microcontroller then transmits the signal to the motor driver ICs to operate the motors. 
Since this robot is controlled by dialing a call so we can also call it as DTMF controlled robot
Applications and Advantages:
•	Cell phone controlled robot can be used in borders for disposing hidden land mines.
•	The robot can be used for reconnaissance or surveillance.
FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1) The bot will made to work amphibiously, i.e., on both land and water.
2) It will be used for video surveillance. Clubbing DTMF control with video tracking would allow the user to have a complete command over the bot over an infinite range (provided a good signal strength).
